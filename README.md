# Software Engineering AE2

1. This is the main repo for the project. Please fork this repo to do your work. 
2. The `main` branch is for stable code. **<u>Never</u>** directly push or send a pull request to the `main` branch of this (main) repo.
3. The `develop` branch is the place for <u>developed</u> features. You can make new branches for each feature from the develop branch. Do not push directly to this branch in the main repo. Develop on a feature branch, when the function is okay, send a pull request to the `develop` branch of the main repo.
4. A good way to manage your repo is to name each feature branch like `feature/[feature-name-goes-here]`.
5. Using Eclipse for collaboration may be a hurdle. The easiest way to run this project is to navigate to the `./src` folder and run

```bash
javac ApplicationController.java && java ApplicationController
```
