## Details of this repo

1. This is supposed to be the main repo for the project.
2. The easiest way to run this project is to navigate to the `.` folder and run

```bash
javac src/ApplicationController.java && java src/ApplicationController
```

3. Running the tests would require an IDE. However, IntelliJ IDEA is suggested because my Eclipse doesn't seem to like this code.
